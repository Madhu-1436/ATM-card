# ATM-card
I developed a functional ATM interface in Java that allows users to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds. This project helped me strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming, error handling, and working with user inputs. It was a great hands-on experience in applying Java to real-world scenarios.
